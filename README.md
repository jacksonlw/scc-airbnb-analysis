# Analysis of Airbnb Listings in Santa Clara County, California (23 December, 2024)

We aim to identify the key characteristics of high-performing Airbnb properties in Santa Clara County. By analyzing key features like host responsiveness, pricing, reviews, and more, we hope to discover what makes a listing successful in the area. While this project is a good data science exercise for us, itâ€™s also an opportunity to learn more about the community we grew up in.

## How to Use

1. Run `download.ipynb` to download, clean, and export the InsideAirbnb listings data into a `scc_airbnbs.csv` file in this directory. This file will be used for further analysis.

   - `scc_airbnbs.csv` is not uploaded to the repository and must be downloaded whenever the repository is cloned.

2. Work with the downloaded data to create visualizations in `viz.ipynb`.
